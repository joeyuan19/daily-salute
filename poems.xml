        Challenge all your suffering
        Try to see the light
        When it feels most desperate
        Then the time is right
        To reach within your soul
        And grasp what lies within
        To beg of all your instincts
        To find the friend within
        Stranger danger lurks outside
        When inside it is alive
        Understand mortality
        And may you never die.

        To An Unarmed Man:
    </title>
    <content>
        I saw a man today
        Assaulted by a cop
        For sitting on a crate
        And drinking a large pop
        Apparently there was a scuffle
        With him and another man
        But for the 20 minutes I was there
        He didn't lift a hand.
        A smile, yes, he did reveal to people passing by
        A smooth assurance of the present
        As a gift from life
        With him stood his friend
        As strangers we both watched
        Them cuff him - take his dignity
        With an ugly scoff.
        I can't explain the feeling
        That welled up deep inside
        I am not sure what happened but I know
        They stole his rights.

        I Think About
    </title>
    <content>
        Sometimes I think about the earth
        Her magic, struggle &amp; her girth
        Sometimes I think about the King
        Who raged a war on everything
        Sometimes I think about us all
        The people living on this ball
        Our pains, our woes - misunderstood
        Our joy and danger, the fight for food
        Sometimes I think about our Beauty
        Shiny, shallow, oh so soothing
        Natures vastness lets me see
        It all is fleeting
        Like a dream
        When waking we do realize
        That all those pains were glorified
        The silly things that caused us fear
        Were brain cells blinking ear to ear
        If dream to waking so swiftly changes
        From terror to submerged rages
        If awake we feel content
        But sleeping dwell we in torment
        Then the terror lives within
        Address it 'fore ye make your kin.

I met a man today
who always drives the train
On his face there was a smile
When we talked a while
He left a sweet refrain
As he walked away
I met a man today who always drives the train.
I saw a man today
Hungry on the streets
He begged for all our mercy
With claims that he was thirsty
I walked right on by, no time for his defeats
He watched me walk away and had nothing to say.
Yesterday I saw a woman
Struggling with her bags
I thought about her bags and I thought about her hands
Wouldn't it be nice to take that weight away
So she could stand up straight
So she could one day say:
"Kids today are kind
That one especially
I didn't know they had it in them
To be so kind to me"
And then I thought,
How lame it is that this is what I think
No real concern with her strife
I'm worried about me.
Everyday I see a woman sitting on a stoop
The way she sits it looks like she has nothing left to lose
Today I saw a woman in a floral dress
Headed to the office, swimming with her stress
Today I saw a man who drives a big fat truck
And delivers lots of boxes so we can have our stuff
Today I saw two men pushing their sweet friend
Because he's in a wheelchair, on them he can depend
Yesterday I saw a family walking down the street,
Blonde hair, blue eyes and accents, they all looked rather sweet
Recently I met a cabbie who gave me some advice
He made me think just maybe there's more to life that's nice
The other day I saw a friend go out for an audition
I got really excited because she lives her vision
Following her dreams, regardless of who cares,
Pushing all the limits, never fronting airs.
Today I saw a country
Each person different from the next
And I thought how blessed I am that I have the chance
To question all their choices
And judge them left to right
That I have the freedom
To choose from day through night.
Today I saw a country
Not so far away
Where freedom is more distant
Where they don&#39;t get to say
That they don&#39;t like their president
Or they don&#39;t like their laws
Forced out of their homes
Displaced
From their kids and jobs.
Today I passed a man
Talking about the day
America lost her freedom
In a similar way
And I thought about the day
Black smoke and big airplanes
And I thought about the names
Of all those souls passed on
And I thought
If we work together this whole struggle could be done.
Maybe we aren't so different from those people far away
In fact; if we got together I think we'd have a lot to say.
Today I saw our country standing hand in hand
With the people of all places, all those other lands
And I remembered something I was taught a long time ago
We are never free
Until the whole world knows
How it feels to wear what you want every single day,
To always get the chance to say what you want to say.

New shoes
New hair
New blues
New prayer
Buy my way through this mess
Money prove my worthlessness
New pants
New bags
New haunts
New fads
Buy my way through this mess
Power prove my worthlessness
New jobs
New laughs
New frauds
New traps
Push on the conveyer belt
Work that thing harder
Grab all your money
Don't be a martyr
Buy your way through this mess
Money is my consciousness
Debt and more debt
Everywhere you go
More pain and less gain
What do you think you know?
Conspiracies line the streets
How can you trust those you meet?
Make that money, and come Friday
Spend it at the bar,
Spend it on new friends
Spend it on new scars.
What did you think you know?
Conspiracies line the snow.
Dance til you think you're dead
Make sure the song is stuck in your head
Feed the big plot
Wonder what you're not
Eat all the potion
Drink all the Kool-Aid
Buy your way through this mess
Before you lose your happiness.

Because
</title>
<content>
Because
I don't know what to say
Because
I don't know how to think
Because
I don't know how to pray
Because
I think I'll sink
Because
There is no reason
Because
There is no rhyme
Because
There is no season
Because
Of the same crime
Because
Of crimes against humanity
Because
Of crimes against who cares
Because
So many people dying does not equal good affairs
Because
Terror is allowed to reign
Because
Gas prices must be low
Because
Three white men were brutally slain
Because
Bombs are the way to go
Because
I question what is right
Because
I wonder every night
Why
I am one who was born white
Why
Destiny puts up a fight
Why
Democracy is such a fright
Why
Presidents can't see the light
Why
People get scared at night
Why
So many lives are marred in plight
When
Will we see a difference
When
Will it all be clear
That
Differences in people
Are
Not something to fear
When
Will we see the cause
Through
The smokey haze
When
Will we toss
Away
The shame of our own hate
How
Can we make this better
How
Can we see the day
Through
The darkest night
Is there something we can say?

French fries, fresh toast
Freedom flags, French roast
Tag a friend, create your life
More Facebook friends, less strife
Who are you?
Without the pain
Who are you?
In the mundane
Who are you?
Without the web
Who are you?
Within the ebb
Does your life begin and end
With the stories of your friends
On snap chat or Instagram
Do you struggle to hold hands?

Are we products of technology
What is epistemology?
Why are we struggling to
Figure out why I'm like you
Why are we struggling to see
What makes you so much like me
Can we find a comfort
In our insecurities
Can we find some happiness
In our simplest strategies
Can we find what makes us real
And really learn how to feel
Or will we maintain
This robotic mainframe?

Dance with me
Don't you iPhone 6 me
Live with me
Don't you call me crazy
Love with me
Show me how to be me
Teach me
How to live in a world without these
Computers in our pockets
Robots in our sockets
People selling lockets
Filled with greed and dockets
Of what we're worth on the internet
Of how to judge people we've never met
Can you please love me
In modern day reality?
I don't need no Siri
She makes me feel too leery.

I want you
I want the world
To see what life's about
I want you
I want the world
To really truly shout
I want you
I want the world
To trust in tangibility
I want you
I want the world
To show me - please - humanity.

You are golden sunshine
With a smiling face
You are the salty ocean
And grass after the rain.
In your eyes the stars are shining
Your smile lights the night
Your giggles are contagious
And your wrinkles, a delight.

Your spirit holds a secret
So lovely, so serene
You heart it holds the melody
Of the most delicate dreams.
Your words ignite within me
A power so surreal
That you can only guess at
How strong you make me feel.

I can't always be near you and it sickens me to think
That life could keep us distant
If even for one blink.
And yet, I am still grateful for the time we are apart
For when we are apart, our hearts become one heart...

Somewhere in a forest the sapling smiles up at the tree,
You will never know how much you mean to me.

 Together we have danced
Until our feet shut down
Together we have laughed
Until the tears poured down
Together we have cried,
Mended each other&#39;s stings
Together we have lied
And attempted crazy things
Together we have spent
Many hours in the dark
Sharing secrets and love stories,
Learning each other&#39;s hearts
Together we have slept
In a big, white fluffy bed
Together we have mourned
The loss of some good friends
Together we have travelled
To great and distant lands
Together we have travelled
All the way to Wisconsin
Together we have wondered
What our lives are all about
Together we have dreamed
And eliminated doubt.

I think of you daily
And today especially
Because today we get to celebrate
The wonderful, Sydney!

Together there is so much
We have yet to do
Know this, my dear dear friend
I am me because of you.

I love ya, Sydder!

Interesting isn't it?
How we see so clear?
Understand so little
Can't bother to really hear
The different things life tells us
Our worlds dictated by fear
Fear of love, fear of intimacy
Fear of differences, fear of tears...
And in our deep awakening
We judge others who don't see
The world according to us
... Why can't you be like me?
Why must you threaten all my safety
And challenge all my woes?
Why must you damage all my virtues
And make fun of my nose?
Why can't you love my society?
Why judge my superficiality?
Can't you see my way's the right way?
Can't you love all I have to say?

Wait...
You're just being you?
You like the way you look?
You're just being you?
You've got your own small nook
Of this great big world
That we all must share?
You're just being you?
And wait... Do you care?

If I talk to my country
And then you talk to yours
Could we ditch all the lame stuff
And build a world of scores?
Imagine
Different melodies all singing one big song
With that awesome harmony
How could anything go wrong?
So I'll talk to my media
And challenge them to stop
Demonizing your life
And questioning your lot,
And you talk to your friends
Let's see what we can do!

Making a real difference
Can start with me and you.

Everyday I wake up
The sun also rises
Everyday I wake up
I get to see some niceness
All the grumpy looks
And all the smiles too
On different people's faces
And then I think of you.
People I'll never meet
Become my favorite treat
All these different feet
Now walking down the street
To someone on this planet
That person is their star
In this great big universe
My star is what you are.
Sleepiness vanishes and happiness sets in
Maybe it's the coffee
Or the thought of you, my friend.

Every day I wake up
And I think about your toes
I think about your toes and how they grow and grow
Every day I wake up
And I get to see the sky
The puffy, dreamy clouds
And the sun's beautiful light
Every day I wake up
And I see that great big sky
And it warms me deep inside
To think, that sky is in your eyes
Every day I wake up
And I make some brand new friends
And I'm reminded that
Life
Never really ends
We all pass on our virtues
And we all pass on our light
And in the deeper darkness
We see the same moon shining in the night.
Every day I wake up
And I thank the world around
For giving me sweet joy -
All these glorious souls abound.

 No one speak
Everyone quiet
So close together
Don't start a riot
No one move
Contain your space
Have no hope
For our human race
No one touch
That's too real
If we touch
We're forced to feel
No one listen
No one care
Keep some distance
Check your hair
Put your head
Inside your phone
Hear your music
On your own
Make your money
But not here
Make it where there is no fear

Fear of one another
Of what we just might do
If we all could really talk
And actually listen to
One another's thoughts
And one another's words
Human connection?
Well that stuff's for the birds.

Purple veins
White light
Smiles shining
Oh so bright
Red pants
Blurred sight
Dogs on leashes
Friendly fights
Lavender
And ginger spice
Chicken platos
Girls that are nice
Screaming people
Here and there
Desperate people
Everywhere.
Desperate for attention
Desperate for some love
Desperate to know what's going on
Desperate to be enough.

Don't you look too closely
I beg you not to see
That what I'm trying to hide
Is that I'm just being me.
My clothes they aren't so cool
And my shoes have got some holes
In my sleep I drool
And I'm stepping over coals
Trying to see clearly
Through this foggy fray
Crammed on this rickety subway
Trying not to say
Something that is hurried
About loneliness and getting paid
Man, I'm far too worried
On a loverly Friday.

I'm a Dreamer
And you can be a Dreamer too
... I should warn you
Sometimes Dreamers catch the blues.
Some say it's because our skin is too soft
That we're full of silly ideas that keep us aloft
Some say we are dull
They ask:
"Why can't you fit in?
Why can't you be realistic,
Like your friends?"
Some say we talk too much
About fantasies
And that we will always, always be lost in our dreams
Some say we are desperate
Searching for gold
When it's all been found
And now we're stuck in a hole.
The Naysayers don't get it
They see our defeats
They don't see that we'd rather
Live out on the streets
Than put our hands in the air
And give up our dreams
That we'd rather eat hair
Than release all our steam.

But the Naysayers, they know us
For they are Dreamers too
They're dreams are just a different shade of blue
What the Naysayers don't realize
Is that they've got hearts
And inside their hearts
Is the beginning, the start.

So yes, sometimes we can get very sad
But sometimes being sad isn't all that bad
Sadness is a teacher
It says, "Hello there
Let me show you what you think is fair
How far will you go to be happy?
Come on, Dreamer,
Let's make it snappy,
It's time to take hold of your Self
Dreamer oh Dreamer,
What is your internal wealth?"

So fellow Dreamer, next time there's a frown
Don't let it turn your whole world upside down
Don't only see your defeats
See instead what you can accomplish by moving your feet.
The magic that equals a very good dream
Is the belief that your love can move mountains upstream.

Late nights
Road trips
Traffic lights
Fluffy lips
Dancing feet
Magic tricks
Empty streets
Carving sticks
Sugar and cream
Breakfast to go
Crazy dreams
Shoveling snow
Surprise gifts
A meal, then two
Your spirit lifts
Me to the moon.
Magic happens every day
If I'm with you or far away
The things you do
The words you say
Remove the blues
And pave the way
For goodness, kindness, empathy,
Intelligence and philosophy
You lighten up every room
You helped my inner flower bloom
What once was rigid, cold, confused
Has now warmed up and been infused
With belief and trust
In life's big plan
I'm humbled just to hold your hand.
Your friendship is a work of art
Your love is etched within my heart.

Old man passing by
Please don't walk away
Lady who is crying
There is another day
Children playing on the sidewalk
Don't grow up too soon
Don't let someone tell you
You won't make it to the moon
Stranger sitting on the bench
I'm calling out to you
I see you Mr. Mensch
I promise you I do
Begging me for change
I'm sorry I can't stay
I wish I understood
How to make it go away
Walking down the street
How many people do I see
I'll never know what they want
I'll never know what they need.
To you my heart is calling
It stops me on the street
It challenges me to tell you
How much I'd like to meet
You and watch our souls entwine
How I wish I had the courage
To step outside the lines.

I want to tell you that I love you
Every one of you I see
I want to tell you that I feel you
You are a part of me
We are all growing
Flowers surfacing to light
We have all been marred
By life's challenge and its plight
And yet we are all blooming
And we can dream about the day
When we'll break down these chains
And be able to say
Yes, you are my neighbor and I love you with my heart
Yes you, stranger, are my neighbor;
Empathy shall play its part.
